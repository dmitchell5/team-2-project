      I am a rising junior of class 2023 at Brandeis University.  As of
      now I am currently majoring in General Music Studies and I intend to minor in Spanish
      and Computer Science.  I have many interests, ranging from gaming, music, and reading.
      My app is a musical radio app. We have some information and bios for famous classical composers.
      You will also be able to sign in to create your own unique music portfolio, with genres you like! <a href="https://github.com/anthonyquinn0301/personalapp">Here</a>
      is a link to my github page!

      I grew up in various places depending on age: I spent most of my time and school years
      in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, a town close to Springfield. I spent 5th grade to my last year
      of highschool there.  All my grade school years previous were in Springfield.
